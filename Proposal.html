    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>
      The general topic for our project is centered around NBA statistics from players and teams. We want users to have
      access to comprehensive player and team statistics. We also want to allow data-driven discussions and forums with
      thoughts and opinions from community members.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is no official NBA forum where people can post thoughts etc. Currently, small communities are needed on
      Twitter and Instagram, but there’s no official website where everyone can visit. By addressing this gap and
      providing a dedicated NBA website, it has the ability to foster and cultivate a more informed and connected
      basketball community.
    </p>
    <p>
      People post thoughts on NBA stuff on X. This doesn’t work as there is no direct access to player and team data, so
      discussions are not data-driven. These conversations are often more opinion-based rather than fact-based.
      Centralizing people’s thoughts on the current status NBA not only allows greater discussion but could involve real
      community change within the game itself (better reffing, team-community involvement).

    <h2>Users of the Application</h2>
    <p>
      The users of the application will be basketball enthusiasts, basketball players, and basketball coaches. The
      impact this app might have on minority groups is that they can have more information about the NBA players and
      it’s quick to find the information they want. This can also allow for community growth as the app can amplify
      voices and opinions that are not popular.

    <h2>Information Viewed</h2>
    <p>
      We will be looking at player’s positions (PG, SG, PF, C) and statistics. We will include the teams that they are
      currently on as well as their personal information such as height and weight.

    <h2>Solution</h2>
    <p>
      This app will provide users with a centralized platform to find NBA information that they would want to know. This
      app's solution lies in its ability to bring together detailed player and team statistics in one place, allowing
      users to access current stats, compare players, and engage in discussions based on these statistics.
